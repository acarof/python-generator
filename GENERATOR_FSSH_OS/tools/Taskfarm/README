The taskfarm job script (taskfarm.pbs) launches 24 concurrent instances per node
of a serial executable on however many nodes are desired. To use it, modify the
following lines in task.sh according to your needs:

input_file=some_name_based_on_taskindex
input_parameter=some_function_of_taskindex
my_executable=path_to_executable

The taskindex variable allows you to specify different input parameters and/or
input files for each instance of your executable. Each instance produces its
own output and error file.

You should also uncomment the following line in task.sh:

my_executable $input_file $input_parameters > ${taskindex}.out 2> ${taskindex}.err &

Finally you will need to modify the budget line #PBS -A in taskfarm.pbs as well as
job details like walltime, number of nodes, etc.
